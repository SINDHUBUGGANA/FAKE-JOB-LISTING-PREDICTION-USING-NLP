# FAKE-JOB-LISTING-PREDICTION-USING-NLP

Fake job postings are an important real-world challenge that require active solutions. This project aims to provide a potential solution to this problem. The textual data is pre-processed to generate optimal results and relevant numerical fields are chose as well. The output of Multiple models is combined to produce the best possible results. This is done to reduce the bias that a machine learning model has towards the dominant class.

The most interesting part of this project was how certain locations are an epitome of fraudulent jobs. For example, Bakersfield, California has a fake to real job ratio of 15:1. Places like this require some extra monitoring. Another interesting part was that most entry level jobs seem to be fraudulent. It seems like scammers tend to target younger people who have a bachelorâ€™s degree or high school diploma looking for full-time jobs. The most challenging part was text data preprocessing. The data was in a very format. Cleaning it required a lot of effort.
